This sketch is a visualization of the different collision detection algorithms used in the Pong Game lab. To test the different versions, comment in/out the appropriate methods within the draw method as noted. Only one version should be called each time the sketch is run.                               

I wasn't as efficient as I could be setting up the variables and methods, and I'm not sure my calculation for the cornerDistance value is correct (how it accounts for both corners still kind of wrecks my head), but working through it this way helped me understand how the algorithms work.
